# LocationApp
Android (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose) Built an app to fetch and display real-time user location with reverse geocoding and dynamic permission handling using MVVM architecture.
I have built this app as part of a learning exercise from The Complete Android 14 & Kotlin Development Masterclass by Denis Panjuta.
